# AutomaCon 2.0 - September 27-29, 2016

[Elliot Murphy](https://github.com/clokep) and [Stephen DiCato](https://github.com/dicato)
are proposing a lightning talk on challenges and obstacles to running a security
service on modern cloudy infrastructure.

## Abstract
### Painful obstacles to running a professional security product on cloud infrastructure
It turns out not everything is a web app! In this talk we'll cover some noteworthy
obstacles we've encountered over the last year building and operating a MITM
antimalware proxy on AWS and Google Cloud, covering problems with iptables,
load balancers, networking, docker, kubernetes, and the challenges of protecting
moving endpoints.
