# AutomaCon 2.0 - September 27-29, 2016

[Elliot Murphy](https://github.com/statik) and [Stephen DiCato](https://github.com/dicato)
are proposing a lightning talk on challenges and obstacles to running a security
service on modern cloudy infrastructure.

## Abstract
### Painful obstacles to running a professional security product on cloud infrastructure
It turns out not everything is a web app! In this talk we'll cover noteworthy
obstacles encountered over the last year building and operating DNS and
security services on AWS and Google Cloud. Specifically, we'll discuss problems
with iptables, load balancers, networking, docker, kubernetes, and the challenges
of protecting moving endpoints.
