# Why?

---

### *recruiting* talent is hard
### *hiring* talent is hard
### *retaining* talent is hard

---

### You **are not** done on their first day!

---

## 1. Set Goals

---

> working dev env in an hour?

> contribute (patch, pr) on first day?

---

## 2. Document important stuff

---

### *accounts*: GitHub, Slack, Trello
### *host setup*: brew, git, virtualenv
### *developer guide*: conventions, process

---

## 3. Divide & Conquer

---

### *1-on-1* pairing
### *dedicated* time

---

## 4. Package your stuff

---

### `setup.py`
### vagrant
### docker
### GitHub's Boxen

---

## 5. Focus on tooling

---

* `fab dev provision`
* `fab staging deploy`

**focus on hiding the rough edges**

---

### **Bonus:** Checkout Kate Heddleston's blog & Fog Creek interview

---

> I always tell beginners, “If you come across an issue, research it for an hour and then come talk to me.”
