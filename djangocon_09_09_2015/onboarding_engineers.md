## 1. Set Goals

---

## 2. Document important stuff

### *developer guide*: conventions, process

---

## 3. Divide & Conquer

---

### *1-on-1* pairing
### *dedicated* time

---

## 4. Package your stuff

---

### vagrant
### docker
### GitHub's Boxen
### `setup.py`

---

## 5. Focus on tooling

---

* `fab staging deploy`

**focus on hiding the rough edges**

---

### **Bonus:** Checkout Kate Heddleston's blog & Fog Creek interview
