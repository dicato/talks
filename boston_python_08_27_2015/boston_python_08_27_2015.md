# [fit] expectations
## [fit] learn these *5* concepts

## 1. what is async

---

## 2. when to async

## 3. event loop (reactor)

## 4. deferreds

## use twisted
## to build modern
# [fit] services

---

## twisted is...
# [fit] **evented** and *asynchronous*

<!--

Asynchronous: non-blocking against I/O bound tasks (e.g. reading/writing to
a socket). [Jean-Paul Calderone, http://stackoverflow.com/a/6118510/1070085]

Evented: user code is notified by the event loop when something it cares
about happens (e.g. new data is available on a socket). Frequently layered
in Twisted: e.g. new data to new line to new HTTP request.

-->

---

## when to use it

<!--

Why use Twisted?
    * Don't worry about low-level networking
    * Easily handle many connections without blocking
    * Built in parsing of many network protocols.

When shouldn't I use Twisted?
    Twisted will not help you with CPU-bound tasks, e.g. long blocking tasks.

    Twisted is probably not the easiest library if you just want to make an HTTP
    request. (I'd suggest using `requests <http://python-requests.org/>`_.)

# [fit] deferred results through
## [fit] a chain of *callbacks* and **errbacks**

<!--

The chain of callbacks is processed using the following rules:

1.  Result of the callback is always passed as the first argument to the next
    callback.
2.  If a callback raises an exception, switch to errback.
3.  An unhandled failure gets passed down the line of errbacks, creating an
    asynchronous analog to a series of `except:` statements.
4.  If an errback doesnâ€™t raise an exception or return a
    `twisted.python.failure.Failure` instance, switch to callback.

## reactor

---

# [fit] deferreds
## [fit] manage a *callback chain*

<!--

Deferreds are similar to "Promises" or "Futures". They are used to process the
results of an asynchronous function: the function returns (a Deferred)
immediately, callbacks are attached that will received the result of the
previous callback.
